-pure offline writing example: testWriteCalib
  --write out EcalPedestals objects into "EcalPedestals" container; assign IOV to them; write out the pedestal iov object into the "IOV" container
  --register the pedestal iov object token to the metadata service with the tag name "EcalPedestals_2008_test"
  --write out the EcalMapping object into "EcalMapping" container; assign infinite IOV to it; write out the mapping iov object into the "IOV" container(note the same container name here!)
  --register the mapping iov object token to the metadata service with the tag name "EcalMapping_v1"
  --this one single program can be split into two where one writes pedestals and mappings separately.

-data reading through EventSetup: 
   cmsRun --parameter-set load_mapping.txt
   cmsRun --parameter-set load_ped.txt
   --you should see data changes when iov expires.
   --note in the .txt, the usage the tag name as the entry point to the system
   --strange problems with plugin manager: if null pointer error happens, just ignore and try to run a second time.

NOTE: current limitations
  --only support runnumber based IOV implementation 
  --for data reading, if the db is oracle, need to 
	setenv POOL_AUTH_USER cms_xiezhen_dev
        setenv POOL_AUTH_PASSWORD xiezhen123
    should be changed to a smarter way.
  --can't load mapping objects and pedestals objects at the same time due to my limit knowledge of handling complex parameter set....
